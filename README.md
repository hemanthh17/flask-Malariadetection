# flask-Malariadetection
Using Flask and Deep Learning libraries to detect malaria from microscope blood sample images and post the prediction.
The web app was not deployable due to the large size of the models file 
### Out of 13,000 images for each class the model was trained for 200 hence a strong overfitting is observed
## Here is a demo while run on local host
